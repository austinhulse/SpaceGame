This is a demo of the Metaball, Metaline, and Metaplane enemies that were created but weren't integrated into the rest of the game.

To run cd to this directory and enter "make", then enter "./MetaDemo".

By default, the demo shows a Metaball enemy. To see a Metaline enemy, press 2. To see a Metaplane enemy, press 3.

To turn the camera, drag the mouse.

This should work on any computer, but I made this on a Mac so I can't make any promises.
