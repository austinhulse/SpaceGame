Project 5 Code
Jon Tatum

I have been mainly testing on linux, but I did set up a project in VS.
It needs to be updated to work again. 

command line: project5 [animation file .an or object file] [path to texture file]

controls: 

mouse: rotate the entire scene
q,e: move object along z axis
a,d: move object along x axis
w,s: move object along y axis
z,x: rotate object about y axis
c,v: rotate object about x axis 
r,f: scale 
o,l: subdivide mesh / previous mesh
b: reset animation

Bugs: Some normals arent computed / guessed correctly. these areas appear as dark patches on the object

TODO: make subdivision work on animated files (should be a one-two liner)
